                Hello! My name is Johnathan Mainhood. I’ve been in this field of work for a total of 20 years and have loved every 
                moment of it. Eventually I got to a point in my career where I wanted to try starting my own business. Fast forward 
                a few years and now I officially have my own company. It isn’t all easy but I love what I do. For around 5 or so years 
                I’ve had my own company, JM Construction Safety. My goal in this line of work is to help worksites stay safe. Safety 
                is important and without proper safety precautions worksites would be an even more hazardous place. JM plans on keeping 
                the workplace happy, healthy, and above all safe!
